# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 20

## Overview

From zero to a working family location sharing app. Started with foundation and backend infrastructure, added authentication and encryption layers, then built out real-time location features. Ended with mobile polish and Docker deployment.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Working development environment with React Native + Node.js monorepo
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Monorepo setup with shared TypeScript types
- [x] 01-02: React Native Expo project scaffold
- [x] 01-03: Node.js backend scaffold with Express

### Phase 2: Backend Core

**Goal**: API server with PostgreSQL and WebSocket ready for features
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: PostgreSQL schema and connection setup
- [x] 02-02: Express API structure with error handling
- [x] 02-03: WebSocket server integration

### Phase 3: Authentication

**Goal**: Users can join via invite code and maintain sessions
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Invite code generation and validation
- [x] 03-02: JWT token flow and session management
- [x] 03-03: Mobile auth screens and token storage

### Phase 4: E2E Encryption

**Goal**: Zero-knowledge architecture where server cannot read location data
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Shared crypto types and constants
- [x] 04-02: Backend libsodium integration
- [x] 04-03: Mobile libsodium integration
- [x] 04-04: Key exchange API

### Phase 5: Real-Time Location

**Goal**: Family members see each other on map in real-time
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Location and map dependencies
- [x] 05-02: Background location service
- [x] 05-03: MapScreen with OpenFreeMap
- [x] 05-04: Socket integration and family markers

### Phase 6: Mobile Polish & Deployment

**Goal**: Production-ready app deployed to Finland VPS
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Ghost mode (pause sharing)
- [x] 06-02: Battery optimization and settings
- [x] 06-03: Docker setup and VPS deployment

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- pnpm over npm/yarn for monorepo (better workspace support)
- Drizzle ORM over Prisma (lighter weight, pure TypeScript)
- Socket.IO over raw ws (reconnection, mobile-friendly fallbacks)
- jose over jsonwebtoken (Edge compatible, ESM native)
- XChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption (modern, libsodium supported)
- MapLibre over react-native-maps (no Google dependency)
- expo-location over react-native-background-geolocation (simpler, free)

**Issues Resolved:**

- pnpm monorepo type resolution with explicit RouterType annotations
- React Native libsodium initialization with singleton pattern
- Background location task registration with handler pattern

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Broadcast to all users (room-based filtering deferred)
- No refresh tokens (acceptable for family app simplicity)
- No tests written (MVP scope)
